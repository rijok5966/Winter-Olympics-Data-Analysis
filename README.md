# Winter-Olympics-Data-Analysis

The Winter Olympics have grown in popularity since their inception in 1924. After starting with only five sports, several new sports have been added to the Olympic programme since 1992, broadening
the appeal of the Winter Olympics beyond Europe and North America. From 1924 to 1936, the games were held every four years, but were interrupted by World War II in 1940 and 1944 and were later resumed in 1948. Initially, since 1992 the summer and the winter Olympics were held in the same year. But in 1986, The International Olympic Committee (IOC) ruled that Summer and Winter Olympics will be held on separate four-year cycles in alternating even-numbered years. 

As an avid sports fan, I had been following the Summer Olympics since I was a child, but I had little knowledge of the Winter Olympics. This inspired me to investigate and analyse the Winter Olympics,
the participation and performances of various athletes and countries in each season, and the various sports played during each event.
